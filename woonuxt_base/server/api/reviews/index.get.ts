        "Dropped in on a Saturday evening looking for a very simple tattoo. Natasha was available to take me on within 30 minutes and I can't say enough about her professionalism. She worked with me on sizing, placement, and wouldn't start tattooing until we were both over-the-top satisfied with how it looked. This seems like something you'd expect from a tattoo categories, but you'd be surprised!",

Natasha was the sweetest soul out there, she requested us for some time to figure out the perfect way to get the designs out for us and went ahead and got it done in 20-25 minutes. She was kind enough to take my friend through all the steps as it was her first tattoo and made sure all our suggestions were taken into consideration. Love this place, would go here again!',

Natasha guided me through the process and even gave me some tips so I can endure the pain. Lol! To my surprise, it wasnâ€™t that bad! As she said, 'welcome to the other side!' So come on over to this place, they accept walk-ins too which is soooo good! You will be in good hands here.",

        "I got my first tattoo here from Natasha and by the way she works will definitely convince you that she is a skilled professional. I showed her some of the design samples and we discussed which would look better according to its placement. She was really amiable all throughout the time and set me up for an appointment. Getting my first tattoo was a bit painful but Natasha was sensitive, careful, and made me feel very comfortable throughout the tattooing process. Would highly recommend her as your artist. Initially, I didn't even know about the studio but ended up having an experience that will last for a lifetime. Thank you Natasha! I'll be returning back again soon!",
